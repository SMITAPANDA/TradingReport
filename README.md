# TradingReport


Sample of a Trading Report with test coverage

It displays

 Amount in USD settled incoming everyday
 Amount in USD settled outgoing everyday
 Ranking of entities based on incoming and outgoing amount. 

I have used two approaches to implement ranking algorithm.

The Trading Report will  use Jenkins to Continuous Delivery.
